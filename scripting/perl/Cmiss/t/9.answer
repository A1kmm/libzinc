???DB.  Haven't checked the values for component 1 apart from "diagonal" -
???  d^4/dxi1^4 (column 1), d^4/dxi2^4 (column 41), d^4/dxi3^4 (column 81) -
???  which should be 0
???DB.  If the entry is (i,j,k,l) where 1<=i,j,k,l<=3 then the column number
???  for the entry is (((i-1)*3+(j-1))*3+(k-1))*3+l
