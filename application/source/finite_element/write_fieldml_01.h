LAST MODIFIED : 3 January 2008

DESCRIPTION :
Writes an exregion file to <output_file> with <root_region> at the top level of
the file.  Optionally the <write_path> restricts the output to only that part 
of the hierarchy.
If the structure of the file permits it to be written in the old exnode/exelem
format this is done so; this is only possible if the output hierarchy is
two-deep and the second level contains only regions which use their parent's
name space for fields etc. In all other cases, <region> and </region> elements
are used to start and end regions so that they can be nested.
The <write_elements>, <write_nodes>, <write_criterion> and <field_order_info>
control what part of the regions are written:
If <field_order_info> is NULL, all element fields are written in the default,
alphabetical order.
If <field_order_info> is empty, only object identifiers are output.
If <field_order_info> contains fields, they are written in that order.
