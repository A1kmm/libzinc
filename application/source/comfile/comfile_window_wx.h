for removing the comfile_window from a global list of windows is left with the
calling routine. See also Comfile_window_close_CB and

DESCRIPTION :
Allocates and returns a name based on <file_name> that is not currently in use
in the <comfile_window_manager>. Does so by appending a number in angle
brackets.
Up to the calling routine to deallocate the returned string.
