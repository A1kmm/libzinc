LAST MODIFIED : 16 January 2003

DESCRIPTION :
Changes the identifiers of all elements of <cm_type> in <fe_region>.
If <sort_by_field> is NULL, adds <element_offset> to the identifiers.
If <sort_by_field> is specified, it is evaluated at the centre of all elements
in the group and the elements are sorted by it - changing fastest with the first
component and keeping the current order where the field has the same values.
Checks for and fails if attempting to give any of the elements in <fe_region> an
identifier already used by an element in the same master FE_region.
Calls to this function should be enclosed in FE_region_begin_change/end_change.
Note function avoids iterating through FE_region element lists as this is not
allowed during identifier changes.
