DESCRIPTION :
Creates a coloured bar with annotation for displaying the specified 
<component_number> of <spectrum>.
First makes a graphics object named <name> consisting of a cylinder of size
<bar_length>, <bar_radius> centred at <bar_centre> and aligned with the
<bar_axis>, combining the <bar_material> with the <spectrum>. The bar is
coloured by the current range of the spectrum. An extra <extend_length> is added
on to each end of the bar and given the colour the spectrum returns outside its
range at that end.
The <side_axis> must not be collinear with <bar_axis> and is used to calculate
points around the bar and the direction of the <tick_divisions>+1 ticks at which
spectrum values are written.
Attached to the bar graphics_object are two graphics objects using the
<tick_label_material>, one containing the ticks, the other the labels. The
labels are written using the <number_format>.
On successful return a pointer to the bar_graphics_object is put at
<*graphics_object_address>. If there is already a colour_bar at this address it
is cleared and redefined.

The side_axis is made to be orthogonal to the bar_axis, and both are made unit
length by this function.
