DESCRIPTION :
Structures and enumerated types needed to produce graphics primitives but not
specific to any of them. Examples are:
- struct Element_discretization: stores the number of segments used to
represent curves in three xi-directions;
- Triple;

compiling, or the object and its children need compilation.

intermediate storage systems.

incremented by 1. This pattern is expected by the ENUMERATOR macros.

LAST MODIFIED : 1 May 2001

DESCRIPTION :
Enumerator for controlling where discrete objects are placed in the Xi space of
each element, eg. glyphs for element_points.
"CELL" types divide the element into cells of equal size in Xi space.
CELL_CENTRES puts one object at the centes of each cell.
CELL_CORNERS puts an object at the corners of each cell, but not repeating any
on neighbouring cells.
CELL_DENSITY puts a number of randomly-located points in each cell proportional
to the value of a density_field calculated at the centre of the cell and the
volume of the cell determined from the coordinate_field.
Note: the first value will be 0 by the ANSI standard, with each subsequent entry
incremented by 1. This pattern is expected by the ENUMERATOR macros.
Must ensure the ENUMERATOR_STRING function returns a string for each value here.
