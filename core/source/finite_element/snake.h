DESCRIPTION :
Creates a snake out of <number_of_elements> 1-D cubic Hermite elements in
<element_manager> and <element_group>, nodes in <node_manager> and the node
group of the same name in <node_group_manager>. The snake follows the data in
<data_list>. <data_list> is unmodified by this function.
The <fitting_fields> which must be defined on the data are fitted and
defined on the created elements.  The <coordinate_field> is used to determine
distances between points.  If specified, the <weight_field> is evaluated at 
each data point and used to weight the varying importance of that data point.
The <density_factor> can vary from 0 to 1.
When <density_factor> is 0 then the elements are spread out to have the same
length in this coordinate field, when the <density_factor> is 1 then the
elements will each correspond to an equal proportion of the data points.
A positive value of <stiffness> penalises solutions with large second
derivatives; helps make smooth snakes from few data points.
@param nodeset_group  Optional nodeset group to put snake nodes in.
@param mesh_group  Optional mesh group to put snake elements in.
