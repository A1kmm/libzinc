 * Reads finite element groups in exnode/exelem format. Groups in the file are
 * created as child group regions of <region>, sharing its definitions of
 * fields, nodes and elements.
 * It is good practice to read the file into a newly created region and check it
 * can be merged into the global region before doing so, otherwise failure to
 * merge incompatible data will leave the global region in a compromised state.
 * 
 * Where objects not within the file are referred to, such as nodes in a pure
 * exelem file or elements in embedded element:xi fields, local objects of the
 * correct type are made as placeholders and all checking is left to the merge.
 * Embedding elements are located by a region path starting at the root region
 * in the file; if no path is supplied they are placed in the root region. If
 * objects are repeated in the file, they are merged correctly.

 * @param region the region which field data and groups are read into.
 * @param input_file the input stream from which data is read.
 * @param time_index if non-NULL then the values in this read are assumed
 *        to belong to the specified time.  This means that the nodal values
 *        will be read into an array and the correct index put into the
 *        corresponding time array.
