DESCRIPTION :
If the element is a face or line of a cube or square top-level element, converts
the <number_of_xi_points> <xi_points> to be locations in the top-level element.
Also allocates the *<top_level_xi_point_numbers_address> to contain the
appropriate xi_point_numbers relative to the top-level element.
Notes:
1. The xi_points put into this function must have been calculated with the
XI_DISCRETIZATION_CELL_CORNERS more and the number_in_xi determined from the
relation from <element> to <top_level_element> and its <top_level_number_in_xi>.
2. Sets *<top_level_xi_point_numbers_address> to NULL if not ALLOCATED; hence
a return value here indicates that the xi_points have been converted.

LAST MODIFIED : 3 December 2001

DESCRIPTION :
Returns in <xi> the location of the <xi_point_number> out of those that would
be calculated by FE_element_get_xi_points. The default_behaviour is to
Call the above function, extract the xi location and DEALLOCATE the xi_points.
This is quite expensive; for this reason cell_centres and cell_corners in line,
square and cube elements, as well as exact_xi, are handled separately since the
calculation is trivial.

fields, required for DENSITY and POISSON modes. Time is expected to be set in

/*******************************************************************************
LAST MODIFIED : 17 September 1998

DESCRIPTION :
Converts the list of <number_of_xi_points> xi coordinates in the <xi_points>
array from the <element_dimension> (=number of xi coordinates) to the
<parent_dimension>, which must be greater. Only the first <element_dimension>
components of the <xi_points> will therefore have useful values - the remaining
of the 3 components should be zero.

Matrix <element_to_parent> is (parent_dimension) rows X (element_dimension+1)
columns in size, with the first column being the xi offset vector b, such that,
xi(parent) = b + A.xi(element)
while A is the remainder of the matrix. (Appropriate matrices are given by the
face_to_element member of struct FE_element_shape, and by function
FE_element_get_top_level_element_conversion.)
