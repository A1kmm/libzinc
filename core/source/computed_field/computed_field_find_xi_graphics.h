/***************************************************************************//**
 * This function implements the reverse of some certain computed_fields
 * (Computed_field_is_find_element_xi_capable) so that it tries to find an
 * element and xi which would evaluate to the given values.
 * This implementation of find_element_xi has been separated out as it uses
 * OpenGL to accelerate the element xi lookup.
 * The <graphics_buffer_package> is required to connect to the OpenGL
 * implementation. The <find_element_xi_data> is passed in just to avoid
 * reimplementing the code from Computed_field_find_element_xi.
 * <hint_minimums> and <hint_maximums> are used to indicate the range over which
 * the values supplied will vary and <hint_resolution> indicates the resolution
 * at which values will be sampled for element_xi, as this algorithm will
 * generate an element lookup image using these parameters.
 * An <element_dimension> of 0 searches in elements of all dimension, any other
 * value searches just elements of that dimension.
 * The return code indicates if the algorithm should be relied on or whether a
 * sequential element_xi lookup should now be performed.
 * @param field_cache  Cmiss_field_cache for evaluating fields with. Time is
 * expected to have been set in the field_cache if needed.
