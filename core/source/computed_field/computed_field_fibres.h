/***************************************************************************//**
 * Creates a "fibre axes" field type which returns a 9-component (3 x 3 vector)
 * field representing an orthonormal coordinate system which is rotated by
 * 3 Euler angles supplied by a fibre field. Three resulting 3 axes are:
 * fibre  = fibre direction
 * sheet  = fibre normal in the plane of the sheet
 * normal = normal to the fibre sheet
 * Both the fibre and coordinate fields must have no more than 3 components. The
 * fibre field is expected to have a FIBRE coordinate_system, although this is
 * not enforced.
 * Note that this initial orientation of the coordinate system (i.e. for all
 * Euler angles zero) is right handed coordinate system:
 * fibre axis = aligned with d(coordinates)/dxi1
 * sheet axis = in plane of fibre axis and d(coordinates)/dxi2 but corrected to
 * be closest vector to d(coordinates)/dxi2 which is normal to fibre axes.
 * normal axis = cross product fibre (x) sheet
