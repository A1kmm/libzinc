/***************************************************************************//**
 * Find location in mesh or element where the field has same or nearest value to
 * the prescribed values. This routine is either called directly by
 * Computed_field_find_element_xi or if that field is propagating it's values
 * backwards, it is called by the last ancestor field implementing
 * propagate_find_element_xi.
 *
 * @param field  The field whose values need to match.
 * @param field_cache  Cmiss_field_cache for evaluating fields with. Time is
 * expected to have been set in the field_cache if needed.
 * @param values  Array of values to match or get nearest to. Implementation
 * promises to copy this, hence can pass a pointer to field cache values.
 * @param number_of_values  The size of the values array, must equal the number
 * of components of field.
 * @param element_address  Address to return element in. If mesh is omitted,
 * must point at a single element to search.
 * @param xi  Array of same dimension as mesh or element to return chart
 * coordinates in.
 * @param mesh  The mesh to search over. Can be omitted if element specified.
 * @param find_nearest  Set to 1 to find location of nearest field value, or 0
 * to find exact match.
 * @return  1 if search carried out without error including when no element is
 * found, or 0 if failed.
