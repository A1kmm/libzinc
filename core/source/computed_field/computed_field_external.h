DESCRIPTION :
Converts <field> to type COMPUTED_FIELD_EXTERNAL.
<source_fields> must point to an array of <number_of_sources> pointers to
Computed_fields. The resulting field will have as many
components as <number_of_sources> * components + number_of_source_values.
If function fails, field is guaranteed to be unchanged from its original state,
although its cache may be lost.

DESCRIPTION :
If the field is of type COMPUTED_FIELD_EXTERNAL, the function allocates and
returns in <**source_fields> an array containing the <number_of_sources> source
fields making up the composite field - otherwise an error is reported.
It is up to the calling function to DEALLOCATE the returned array. Note that the
fields in the returned array are not ACCESSed.
