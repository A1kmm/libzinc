read between the calls. This read should occur after Cmiss_fdio_set_read_callback
is called. The callback will also be called if the underlying descriptor is
closed by the peer. The callback is not one-shot, and the callback remains in
effect until it is explicitly cancelled.

this function is passed NULL as the callback parameter, the read callback
previously set will be cancelled.
