/***************************************************************************//**
 * Creates a field whose values are the 4x4 transformation matrix mapping
 * coordinates between two graphics coordinate systems for a scene viewer.
 * The matrix maps homogeneous coordinates (x,y,z,1) to (x',y',z',h') suitable
 * for passing to a projection field. The values are continuously updated with
 * changes to the scene_viewer and become invalid if the scene_viewer is
 * destroyed.
 * Note CMISS_GRAPHICS_COORDINATE_SYSTEM_LOCAL gives the local coordinate system
 * of the rendition for the owning region of field, which is transformed from
 * world coordinates by the cumulative transformation matrices of all renditions
 * down from the root region of the scene viewer's scene.
 * @see Cmiss_field_module_create_projection.
 *
 * @param field_module  Region field module which will own new field.
 * @param scene_viewer  Handle to Cmiss_scene_viewer object.
 * @param from_coordinate_system  The input coordinate system for the
 * transformation.
 * @param to_coordinate_system  The output coordinate system for the
 * transformation.
 * @return  Newly created field with 16 components.
